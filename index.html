      <h1>About</h1>
      <h2>Ellen Joe</h2>
      <p>Ellen Joe The Frosty Fang of Victoria Housekeeping

Ellen Joe is an S-Rank Agent from the Victoria Housekeeping faction in Zenless Zone Zero. Known for her shark-like features and icy demeanor, she wields a massive scissor-shaped weapon and specializes in Ice-elemental attacks. Though she often appears lazy and sleepy—frequently seen sucking on a lollipop—Ellen becomes a fierce and relentless fighter when duty calls.

With her quiet strength, cool attitude, and sudden bursts of deadly power, Ellen strikes a balance between elegance and ferocity. Whether she's napping in the lounge or freezing enemies on the battlefield, she leaves an impression as cold as her blade.
